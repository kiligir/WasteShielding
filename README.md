## What Is This Mod?

<img alt="What Is This Mod?" src="https://i.imgur.com/DurTbNL.png" />

Waste Shielding adds 6 new parts, custom models, and recipes to let you shield and dispose of both types of nuclear waste. Unlock new milestones, automate Mercer spheres, and discover nearly 20 alternate recipes that don't waste the waste!

## New Parts

<img alt="New Parts" src="https://i.imgur.com/NaFGrKX.png" />

- **Lead ore** — refined from sulfur in a Refinery.  
- **Lead reduction agent** — made in a Manufacturer.  
- **Lead ingots** — forged from the previous two parts in a Foundry.  
- **Lead sheets** — assembled from lead and aluminum ingots in an Assembler.  
- **Shielded waste** — assembled from plutonium waste and lead sheets in an Assembler.  
- **Biowaste** — blended from non-fissile uranium in a Blender.  

If you don't want to bother with plutonium processing, you can use a bioremediation process that turns non-fissile uranium into **biowaste**. This unlocks refinery and blender recipes as well as packaging/unpackaging for the new biowaste fluid. Biowaste is nonradioactive and must be refined into **biofuel** before it can be burned in a Generator.

</p>

The **Lead Utilization** research tree in the MAM is available after Lead Refinement is unlocked in the HUB. It contains twenty (20) nodes. Branches off the spine are alternate recipes, while the spine itself is alternates for the new parts.

**Highlights include:**
1. Alternate: Filtered Lead – extracts remaining lead from sulfuric acid runoff.  
2. Alternate: Lead Acid Battery – combines lead ore, sulfuric acid, and alumina solution.  
3. Alternate: Leadweight Quickwire – lead + caterium + water → quickwire.  
4. Alternate: Crystal Reduction Agent – coal + silica → reduction agent.  
5. Alternate: Remediated Turbofuel – reduction agent + biofuel → turbofuel.  
6. Alternate: Reduction Steel – reduction agent → steel ingots.  
7. Alternate: Sulfuric Ingot – sulfur + reduction agent → lead ingots.  
8. Alternate: Lead Wire – lead ingots → wire.  
9. Alternate: Lead Fluid Tank – lead ingots → fluid canisters.  
10. Alternate: Etched Lead Sheets – lead + nitric acid → sheets.  
11. Alternate: Heavy Lead Frame – lead sheets + modular frames.  
12. Alternate: Shielded Limiter – lead sheets + quickwire → AI limiters.  
13. Shielded Waste – lead sheets + plutonium waste → inert waste.  
14. Alternate: Shielded Biowaste – shield biowaste like reactor waste.  
15. Alternate: Efficient Waste Shielding – uranium + plutonium waste shielding.  
16. Quantum Breakthroughs – turn shielded waste into Mercer Spheres.  
17. Shielded Depot Expansion – expands the Dimensional Depot.  
18. Alternate: Encoded Cells – lead + copper powder + dark matter crystals → singularity cells.  
19. Synthetic Mercer Sphere – quantum encoding → Mercer Spheres.  
20. Mercer Matrices – Mercer Spheres → Alien Power Matrices.

## Mod Compatibility

<img alt="Mod Compatibility" src="https://i.imgur.com/rBc4gb2.png" />

Waste Shielding is available in the [Satisfactory Calculator Production Planner](https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/planners/production). Navigate to the mods tab and select it.

This mod works with nearly all others, but has specific synergy with:

- [Waste Shielding Plus](https://ficsit.app/mod/WasteShieldingPlus) — adds even more lead-based parts.  
- [MAM Enhancer](https://ficsit.app/mod/MAMTips) — makes MAM descriptions readable.  
- [Heavy Fluid Overhaul](https://ficsit.app/mod/HeavyFluids) — rebalances fluid numbers.  
- [Nuclear Rework](https://ficsit.app/mod/NuclearRework) — integrates Waste Shielding into a nuclear overhaul.  
- [Enhanced Depot](https://ficsit.app/mod/EnhancedDepot) — expands the Dimensional Depot further.  

As long as **sulfur** exists in your game, Waste Shielding will work. If you’re a mod author and depend on Waste Shielding, ping me on the [Satisfactory Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/xkVJ73E) and I’ll list your mod here.
