# Waste Shielding


Waste Shielding adds 6 new parts, custom models, and recipes to let you shield and dispose of both types of nuclear waste. Unlock new milestones, automate Mercer spheres, and discover nearly 20 alternate recipes that don't waste the waste!

---

## New Parts

- **Lead ore** - refined from sulfur in a Refinery.  
- **Lead reduction agent** - made in a Manufacturer.  
- **Lead ingots** - forged from the previous two parts in a Foundry.  
- **Lead sheets** - assembled from lead and aluminum ingots in an Assembler.  
- **Shielded waste** - assembled from plutonium waste and lead sheets in an Assembler.  
- **Biowaste** - blended from non-fissile uranium in a Blender.  

If you don't want to bother with plutonium processing, you can use a bioremediation process that turns non-fissile uranium into **biowaste**. This unlocks refinery and blender recipes as well as packaging/unpackaging for the new biowaste fluid. Biowaste is nonradioactive and must be refined into **biofuel** before it can be burned in a Generator.

## Mod Compatibility

Waste Shielding is available in the [Satisfactory Calculator Production Planner](https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/planners/production). Navigate to the mods tab and select it.

This mod works with nearly all others, but has specific synergy with:

- [Waste Shielding Plus](https://ficsit.app/mod/WasteShieldingPlus) - adds even more lead-based parts.  
- [MAM Enhancer](https://ficsit.app/mod/MAMTips) - makes MAM descriptions readable.  
- [Heavy Fluid Overhaul](https://ficsit.app/mod/HeavyFluids) - rebalances fluid numbers.  
- [Nuclear Rework](https://ficsit.app/mod/NuclearRework) - integrates Waste Shielding into a nuclear overhaul.  
- [Enhanced Depot](https://ficsit.app/mod/EnhancedDepot) - expands the Dimensional Depot further.  

As long as **sulfur** exists in your game, Waste Shielding will work. If you’re a mod author and depend on Waste Shielding, ping me on the [Satisfactory Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/xkVJ73E) and I’ll list your mod here.
